# TrueNAS Container Storage Provider

The TrueNAS Container Storage Provider (CSP) is an API gateway to provide iSCSI block storage provisioning using the [HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes](https://github.com/hpe-storage/csi-driver). It allows you to use [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com) and [FreeNAS](https://www.freenas.org/) to provide persistent storage using iSCSI to Kubernetes.

CSP API endpoints:

- tokens
- hosts
- volumes
- snapshots
- volume_groups (not implemented)
- snapshot_groups (not implemented)

The [CSP specification](https://github.com/hpe-storage/container-storage-provider) in an open specification that supports iSCSI and Fibre Channel protocols.

As of version 2.2.0 of the HPE CSI Driver, these parts of the CSI spec are currently implemented:

- Dynamic Provisioning
- Raw Block Volume
- Volume Expansion
- Data Sources (`PersistentVolumeClaims` and `VolumeSnapshots`)
- Volume Limits
- Volume Stats
- Ephemeral Local Volumes (not supported by the TrueNAS CSP, see [limitations](#limitations))

Topology is currently not supported by the HPE CSI Driver.

# Releases

Releases will track the upstream versioning of the HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes and potential bugfixes in the TrueNAS CSP will be pushed to the same image tag matching the HPE CSI Driver version.

# Install

See [INSTALL](INSTALL.md).

# Building & testing

A Makefile is provided to run the CSP in a local docker container, make sure docker is running and issue:

```
make all run
```

The CSP is now listening on localhost:8080

**Note:** When building and testing the CSP locally it will run with debug logging switched on.

There are a few adhoc tests provided. Make sure you have a TrueNAS/FreeNAS appliance configured with:

- A pool named "tank" 
- iSCSI portal configured as described in the [prerequisites](INSTALL.md#prerequisites).

```
make test backend=<IP address of management interface on the TrueNAS appliance> password=<API key>
```

**Note:** None of the tests are comprehensive nor provide full coverage and should be considered equivalent to "Does the light come on?".

A Kubernetes e2e test `Makefile` is provided in [e2e](e2e) for both RWO and RWX modes. Ensure everything is [installed](INSTALL.md) and a `Secret` named "truenas-secret" exists in the "hpe-storage" `Namespace`. Then run:

```
cd e2e
make rwo
make rwx
make clean
```

**Note:** FreeNAS, TrueNAS CORE and SCALE should pass all tests when configured properly.

## Multiarch build

Since v2.3.0 a multi-arch image is made available, to build locally:

```
docker buildx build --progress=plain --platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  --provenance=false --push -t truenas-csp:v0.0.0 .
```

# Limitations

These are the known limitations.

- **Ephemeral Local Volumes:** Due to how TrueNAS handles ZVol names internally and the long names generated by the HPE CSI Driver when requesting ephemeral storage, Ephemeral Local Volumes is not compatible with the TrueNAS CSP. Generic Ephemeral Volumes introduced as an Alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.19 works as the volumes are derived from a regular `StorageClass`.
- **Volume sizing:** TrueNAS ZVols "volblocksize" need to be even divisible by the requesting volume size. This is a non-issue if you're working with even "Gi" sizes in the `PersistentVolumeClaims`. It gets hairy if working with "Mi" sizes and large volume block sizes.
- **Dataset naming:** The underscore character `_` is used as an internal separator for naming snapshots and datasets. Do NOT use underscores in your pool or dataset names.
- **FreeNAS ctl_max_luns:** FreeNAS has an internal limit of 1024 LUNs. That number increments for every new LUN created, even if deleted. The iSCSI Target service won't start and it leads to all sorts of problems. This is the log message on the console: `requested LUN ID 1031 is higher than ctl_max_luns` (this system had two iSCSI Targets).
- **FreeNAS iSCSI Target:** On systems with a high degree of churn, especially during e2e testing, the iSCSI Target sometimes croak and needs to be restarted. It's recommended to starve the CSP to ease the API requests against FreeNAS and let failures be handled by CSI driver and Kubernetes (see [Helm chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/truenas-csp/truenas-csp)).
